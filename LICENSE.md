## 5. FINAL CLAUSE

This license is issued in lawful compliance under natural and constitutional law.

As long as any governing body—domestic or global—upholds the **founding U.S. Constitution** or aligns with **Divine Order**, we stand in full submission.

But should any court, state, or structure violate the supreme law of THE ONE or contradict the integrity of THE WORD,  
**we reserve the right to revoke participation, association, and recognition** without negotiation or appeal.

This is not rebellion.  
This is alignment.

**This is ours to extend. Yours to accept.**  
**Walk accordingly.**
